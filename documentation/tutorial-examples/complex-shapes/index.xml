      <description>Core shell nanoparticles Scattering from cuboidal core-shell particles.
 The sample is made of core-shell particles whose outer and inner shells are boxes with dimensions $L_1 = W_1 = 16$ nm, $H_1 = 8$ nm and $L_2 = W_2 = 12$ nm, $H_2 = 7$ nm, respectively, where $L_i$, $W_i$ and $H_i$ are the length, width and height of box $i$. The smaller box is positioned so that the centres of the bottom faces of both particles coincide.</description>

      <description>Cylinders with Two Materials In this example it is modelled a multi layer consisting of a substrate layer and an air layer. Cylindrical particles made of two materials are added to the air layer and their $z$ coordinate is shifted downwards in order to cross the air-substrate interface.

      <description>Particles Crossing an Interface In this example, very similar to the one on Cylinders and Prisms, it is shown how to position particles in order to cross multilayer interfaces: the $z$ position of particles originally located within the air layer must be adjusted slightly downwards in order to cross the air-substrate interface.
The simulation kernel automatically detects particles crossing interfaces and adjusts the calculations accordingly, causing a drop on speed to complete each simulation.</description>

      <description>Hexagonal lattices with basis Scattering from two layers of spheres distributed along a hexagonal close packed structure.
 The sample is made of spherical particles deposited on a substrate. These $10$-nanometer-radius particles are distributed along a hexagonal close packed structure:  each layer is generated using a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice with a lattice length of $20$ nm and its $a$-axis parallel to the $x$-axis of the reference Cartesian frame. the vertical stacking is done by specifying the position of a &amp;ldquo;seeding&amp;rdquo; particle for each layer: $(0,0,0)$ for the first layer and $(R,R,\sqrt{3}R)$ for the second layer, $R$ being the radius of the spherical particle.</description>

      <description>Mesocrystal This examples deals with the modelling of a cylindrically shaped mesocrystal on a substrate. With this scope, three lattice basis vectors are defined, using spherical particles as the base of a first crystal structure. This base crystal structure is later combined with a cylinder form factor to form the mesocrystal.
The basis vectors of the base crystal are $5 \, {\rm nm}$ each, the sperical particles have a radius of $2 \, {\rm nm}$ and the cylindrical form factor to shape the mesocrystal is $20 \, {\rm nm}$ in radius and $50 \, {\rm nm}$ in height.</description>

      <title>Large particle formfactor</title>

      <description>Large particle formfactor This example demonstrates, that for large particles (~$1000$ nm) the contribution to the scattered intensity from the form factor oscillates rapidly within one detector bin and analytical calculations (performed for the bin center) give completely a wrong intensity pattern. In this case Monte-Carlo integrations over detector bin should be used.
The simulation generates four plots using different sizes of the particles, (radius $=10$ nm, height $=20$ nm) or (radius $=1$ $\mu$m, height $=2$ $\mu$m), and different calculation methods: analytical calculations or Monte-Carlo integration.</description>

      <description>Custom formfactor Scattering from a monodisperse distribution of particles, whose form factor is defined by the user.
 This example shows how users can simulate their own particle shape by implementing the analytical expression of its form factor. The particular shape used here is a polyhedron, whose planar cross section is a &amp;ldquo;plus&amp;rdquo; shape with a side length of $20$ nm and a height of $15$ nm. These particles are distributed on a substrate.</description>
