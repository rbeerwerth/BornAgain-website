      <description>Interference 1D lattice In this example we simulate the scattering from infinite 1D repetition of rectangular patches (rectangular grating). This is done by using the interference function of a 1D lattice together with very long boxes.
 By-default, the axis of the one-dimensional lattice coincides with the $x$-axis of the reference cartesian frame, so it coinsides with the beam direction. Long boxes are placed along a one-dimensional lattice on top of substrate, the lattice_length parameter corresponds to the grating period.</description>

      <description>Interference 2D square lattice Scattering from cylindrical particles distributed along a square lattice.
 Cylinders with radii and heights of $3$ nm are deposited on a substrate. Because of the presence of the substrate layer the simulation is run using the DWBA. The particles are distributed along a square lattice with a lattice length of $25$ nm. The main axes are parallel to the $x$-axis and $y$-axis of the reference Cartesian frame, respectively.</description>
