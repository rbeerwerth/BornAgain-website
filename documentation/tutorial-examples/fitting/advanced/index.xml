      <description>Fitting with masks In this example we demonstrate how to mask certain areas on the detector image to exclude their influence on the fitting procedure. This can be done by invoking the method addMask on a simulation object.
simulation = GISASSimulation() simulation.addMask(Rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2), mask_value)  where Rectangle is related to the shape of the mask in detector coordinates, mask_value can be either True (area is excluded from the simulation and fit) or False (area will stay in the simulation and will be taken into account in $\chi^2$ calculations during the fit).</description>

      <title>Fitting along slices</title>

      <description>Fitting along slices Here we demonstrate how to fit along slices. The idea is that the user defines the positions of vertical and horizontal lines crossing the detector plane in regions of most interest (Yoneda wings, Bragg peaks, etc.) and then finds the sample parameters which fits those regions best.
Such an approach uses much less CPU while still giving a chance to find the optimal sample parameters. In general, however, it is arguable whether fitting along slices makes more sense than fitting using the whole detector image.</description>

      <description>Find background This example demonstrates how to introduce a background in the simulation and fit its value. Here we are simulating cylinders on top of a substrate without interference. The simulation builder function, defined at line 42, requires 4 parameters:
 the height of the cylinders the radius of the cylinders the value of the constant background a scale factor for the beam&amp;rsquo;s intensity  The radius and height of the cylinders are passed to the function constructing the multi layer while the scale and background values are used to initialize the instrument.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous fit of two datasets</title>

      <description>Simultaneous fit of two datasets In this example we demonstrate how to fit two datasets simultaneously.
Suppose that we have a sample measured twice for two different incident angles. We are going to fit both datasets simultaneously to find the unknown sample parameters.
To do this, we define one dataset (a pair of real data and corresponding simulation builder) for the first incidence angle and another pair for the second incidence angle.</description>
