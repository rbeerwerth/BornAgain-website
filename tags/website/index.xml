      <description>Website and mailing list migration  Dear BornAgain users,
We are migrating our BornAgain documentation to a new website. Our current Drupal based version, as you know it, will go to the other world. But no need for sadness - the new version will be better and will be available under the same address www.bornagainproject.org. The side effect of this migration is that we have to discontinue our current mailing list.</description>
